public class Hashing {
    //in hashing we can access data faster than arrays
    //hasing has a function with which it stores data
    //hashing can have collisions when two elements have the same output of the hashing function
    //collision can be resolved by:
    //1.open addressing,2.chaining
    //1.open addressing: we put the elements in the first empty location present
    //2.chaining:we use a linked list so that we can use the same position for different values

    //types of hashing techniques:
    //hashmap,hashset,linkedhashmap
    //if we use any data structure which uses hashing techniques like above then to do linear search the time complexity is constant whereas if we use array then time complexity linearly increases
